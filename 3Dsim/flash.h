This is a project on 3D_SSDsim, based on ssdsim under the framework of the completion of structures, the main function:
1.Support for 3D commands, for example:mutli plane\interleave\copyback\program suspend/Resume..etc
2.Multi - level parallel simulation
3.Clear hierarchical interface
4.4-layer structure

Description:
flash layer: the original ssdsim this layer is not a specific description, it was their own package to achieve, not completed.
