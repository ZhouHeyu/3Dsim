This is a project on 3D_SSDsim, based on ssdsim under the framework of the completion of structures, the main function:
1.Support for 3D commands, for example:mutli plane\interleave\copyback\program suspend/Resume..etc
2.Multi - level parallel simulation
3.Clear hierarchical interface
4.4-layer structure

FileName£º fcl.h
Author: Zuo Lu 		Version: 1.9	Date:2017/10/11
Description:
fcl layer: remove other high-level commands, leaving only mutli plane;
